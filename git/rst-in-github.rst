reStructured Text in Github
===========================
:visible-date: 2016-08-03
<meta name="hidden-date" content="2016-08-04" />

In order to publish a page as a blog, pelican requires a bunch of metadata.
I'm considering adding these TIL notes to the blog so there will be a nice RSS feed, but I don't want to muddy the repo with a bunch of useless markup.

So, I added some useless markup to this rst file, and I will see how Github handles it.
I'm actually learning something with my TIL post :).

Looks like the metadata wrapped in colons is still visible.
Let's test an HTML meta attribute... Dang. Still visible, and twice as ugly.
