# Spell check in Vim

I'm using markdown, pelican, vim, and Github to write/host these snippets and my [blog](blog.harterrt.com).
Spell check in vim is a necessity. Here are some helpful commands:

* `set spell spelllang=en_us` to enable spell check
* ]s and [s to move between misspelled words
* z= to bring up list of alternative spellings for highlighted word.
* zg to add a false positive to the dictionary
